# Spotify-API-Playlist-Creator

Using the Spotify Web API, this code authenticates a user and visualizes their 
top listened-to genres in a matplotlib chart. Lists of the users top artists
and top songs (all genre specific) are created. This information is used to create
a new playlist for each of the users top 3 genres and fill the playlists with 50
songs that are personalized to the specifc genre, and the users specific preferences
within each genre.
